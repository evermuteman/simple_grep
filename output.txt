Let me guess, you are looking for word to
and I can find it in poem.txt
Got it!
Your file contains:
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

Such beautiful text!

The words you are looking for are in these lines:

Are you nobody, too?

How dreary to be somebody!
